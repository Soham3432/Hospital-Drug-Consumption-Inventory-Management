# Hospital-Drug Consumption-Inventory Management

Description:

This repository contains data analysis and visualization code for hospital drug consumption and inventory management. The project aims to:


- Analyze drug consumption patterns in hospitals
- Identify trends and anomalies in drug usage
- Optimize inventory management to reduce waste and improve efficiency
- Develop predictive models to forecast drug demand
- Analyzed datasets from the World Healthcare Department, incorporating real-time data from patients and hospitals to predict medication requirements.
- Utilized data analysis and visualization tools for forecasting, training, and testing historical data to optimize hospital inventory management.

 Contents:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning scripts
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks
- Data visualization dashboards (e.g., Tableau, Power BI)
- Machine learning models for demand forecasting
- Inventory optimization algorithms


Technologies Used:

- Programming languages: Python
- Data analysis libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly
- Data visualization tools: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine learning frameworks: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

Data Sources:

- Hospital drug consumption data
- Inventory management data
- External data sources (CDC, WHO)

Goals:

- Improve drug inventory management efficiency by 20%
- Reduce drug waste by 15%
- Enhance predictive accuracy of drug demand forecasting by 30%
